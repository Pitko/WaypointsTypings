TypeScript typings for Waypoints

I missed TypeScript typings for [Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/) library.
Plugin author said he won't deliver it 
([see comment](https://github.com/imakewebthings/waypoints/issues/410#issuecomment-111875710)) thus I decuided to write
it myself.

Here you'll find single file **waypoints.d.ts** which covers whole [Waypoints API](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/api/waypoint/)
